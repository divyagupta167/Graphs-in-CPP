// What is graph?
// It is a data structures containing nodes and edges

//It is of two types considering edges
//Undirected (no direction between edges)and directed graph (direction between edges,directed edges in a particular direction)

// Indegree and Outdegree of a graph
// The number of edges outgoing and incoming at a node is a degree
// The number of edges outgoing  at a node is a out-degree
// The number of edges  incoming at a node is a in-degree
// The total degree of all the nodes is twice of all the edges( 2 x E )

//What is a path ?
//For a undirected graph, it is a sequence of nodes or vertex such that none of the nodes are  visted twice or repeated
//For a directed graph, it is a sequence of nodes or vertex such that none of the nodes are  visted twice or repeated also we have to take care of the direction of the edges

// Cyclic graph
// We can call a undirected graph a cyclic if we can reach to the starting node via other nodes through another paths and it is called a undirected cyclic graph
// We can call a undirected graph a a-cyclic if we cannot reach to the starting node via other nodes through another paths and it is called a undirected a-cyclic graph
// We can call a directed graph a cyclic if we can reach to the starting node via other nodes through another paths and it is called a directed cyclic graph
// We can call a directed graph a a-cyclic if we cannot reach to the starting node via other nodes through another paths and it is called a directed a-cyclic graph


//Weighted graph
//If the weight of the edges are given between two nodes
// Weighted-Directed graph and Weighted-undirected graph
