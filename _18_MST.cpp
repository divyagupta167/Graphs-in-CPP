//Minimum Spanning Tree
//The graph has to be a  weighted graph
//Spanning Tree :- When we can convert a graph into a tree such that it contains, exactly N nodes and N-1 edges(where N is the number of vertices of the graph), and also every node should be reachable by other node
//MST:- Spanning Tree, but the edges should have minimum possible weights
//To find the MST we have couple of algorithms --> Prim's algorithm and  Kruskal algorithm
